        <p>
            SEO stands for Search Engine Optimisation, and is the process of making a website rank above other websites.
            Search Engines like Google use algorithms based off the PageRank algorithm, which judges the importance
            webpages based on links.
            However, Google is more advanced than it used to be, and it's web crawlers read the contents of the page and
            assess how relevant it is to the search query.

        <p>
            Scientific papers are deemed more reliable if they have more citations, and the same applies to webpages. If

        <h1>Metamorphosis Parsnip Universe</h1>

        <h2>Chapter 1: The Carrot Invasion</h2>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, parsnips lived freely in all corners of The Netherlands. Its flat, fertile landscape was
            perfect for growing, and communities thrived in the temperate climate. That was, until the day that the
            first carrots arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
            Carrots were favoured by the ruling class, with their sweet taste and deep orange colour commemorating the
            House of Orange. Up and down the country, parsnips were pulled up, with carrots planted in their place.
            Carrots were the new trend, and the people wanted more.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day, a group of parsnips had had enough, and decided they could not live in The Netherlands any longer.
            All of the land and water was being dedicated to carrots, and there was nothing left for them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the cover of darkness, the group embarked on a journey across the vast fields and meadows. They
            encountered many challenges along
            the way, from
            navigating through dense thickets to weathering fierce storms.
        </p>
        <p>
            After many days of travel, the parsnips stumbled upon a fertile island, rich with nutrients and bathed in
            warm sunlight.
            Excited by the discovery, they wasted no time in preparing the land for their new settlement. With the
            collective effort
            of the entire group, they cleared the area, tilled the soil, and planted the first seeds of their new
            parsnip community.
        </p>
        <p>
            As time passed, the settlement flourished. The parsnips worked together to build fences from sturdy twigs
            and
            leaves,
            designed to withstand the elements. They developed a system for watering the new generation, and established
            a system of government.
        </p>
        <p>
            With hard work, unity, and a shared vision, the parsnips transformed the once untamed land into a thriving
            home. But the peace would not last for long. One fateful night, a mischievous band of inquisitive carrots
            stumbled across the parsnip settlement and were shocked at what they saw. How could this mutiny against the
            trend have been allowed to happen! Without hesitation, they rampaged the island, mercilessly
            uprooting the innocent parsnips and planting more carrots in their place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enraged by this brazen act of sabotage, the parsnips banded together, united by their strength in numbers
            and hatred for the carrots. They were determined to defend their livelihood and put an end to the carrot
            infestation.
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 2: Metamorphosis</h2>
        <p>
            While the majority of the parsnips charged into battle, with a burning passion to beat the carrots by force,
            one wise parsnip noticed a peculiar pattern. The carrots had settled almost all of the banks of the island,
            except for one small area near a cliff. It seemed to contain a different type of rock to the rest of the
            island, which glistened in the sunlight like glitter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Curious, the parsnip waddled towards the cliff, determined to get a sample of this rock. But behind, a
            carrot had spotted the vulnerable parsnip, and was chasing furiously towards it. Desperate, the parsnip
            threw the rock at the carrot - and was shocked at what happened next. Immediately, the carrot began to swell
            and elongate, and its vibrant orange hue started to fade! It was metamorphosising into a parsnip!
        </p>
        <p>
            Astonished, the parsnip took another piece of the rock, to test if this worked reliably. If so, they could
            easily fend off the carrots and live in peace once more!
        </p>
        <p>
            Sprinkling it in the ground near a patch of carrots proved this to be true, as their bushy leaves became
            flatter and broader, followed by the perplexed vegetables waking up in confusion. This was it! This was
            their secret weapon!
        </p>
        <p>
            The parsnips held a meeting to discuss the use of this peculiar substance. The plan was to metamorphosise
            the most aggressive front-line carrots, and hopefully scare the rest away without wasting too much rock. And
            so, in the middle of the night, traps were set up, and defensive parsnips armed with the magic rock got into
            position.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following day was a great success for the parsnips! All of the invading carrots were bewildered to find
            themselves transforming into their own enemy, and carrots fled the island in their hundreds! The parsnip
            communities began to celebrate, that the battle was finally over. But for the wise parsnip - this was just
            the beginning...
        </p>
        <h2>Chapter 3: Tulips</h2>
        <p>
            The wise parsnip approached a group of timid-looking carrots. They shrivelled in fear of what the parsnip
            would do to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Wortels, geen angst! Ik zou een deal met jullie sluiten. Als jullie naar Nederland ga, en kom terug met
            tulpen, dan kan je hier met ons leven. Tulpenbloemen, tulpembollen - zo veel tulpen als je kan stelen!"
        </p>
        <p>
            The carrots had little choice but to accept. They set off, back to The Netherlands, and within a week,
            they had returned, with a large brown sack, full to the brim with all kinds of beautiful tulips. The parsnip
            was delighted, and immediately got to
            work testing the new theory. If it works on carrots, does it work on tulips?
        </p>
        <p>
            After sprinkling some of the rock onto a flowering bulb, it began to change. The flimsy, tangled roots
            started to warp together, and grow into a large cone shape, just like a parsnip! But on top, its gorgeous
            red petals remained unchanged. What had just been created was a parsnip that looked like a tulip!
        </p>
        <p>
            The wise parsnip was ecstatic! By disguising as tulips, a new generation of parsnips could return to The
            Netherlands, and grow in flower fields all over the land. The people would love them, and the farmers would
            give them plenty of water and nutrients to grow strong and healthy!
        </p>
        <p>
            The tulips were gradually converted to metamorphic parsnips, and placed back into the sack. "Wortels, ik heb
            nog een taak voor jullie. Breng deze tas terug naar Nederland en plant ze overal!"
        </p>
        <p>
            The carrots carried the sack all the way back again, through the thickets and over the streams until they
            reached the unmistakable fields of Dutch tulips. They carefully buried the tulip parsnips in between the
            flowers, and left them to grow. They moved from field to field, spreading the parsnips all over the eastern
            provinces, until there were none left.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon returning to the parsnips' island, the carrots were treated heroicly, with a compassionate welcome. The
            vegetables learned to live alongside each other, without competing for resources, and the community thrived.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back on the mainland, farmers were shocked to find the strange tulips growing in their fields, though it
            didn't take long for them to realise they could sell both the flowers and the roots, and the new variety
            quickly became popular. Soon, parsnips were being planted up and down the country once again, free from the
            competition the carrots had first created.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so finally, parsnips could live in harmony with carrots and tulips, and all was peaceful and balanced.
            Until the beetroots arrived...
